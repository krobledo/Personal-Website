	<h2>Kenneth Robledo's </h2>
<p>As a freshman at the University at Buffalo, I believe there
are many qualities that I have that set me apart from the group, especially
experiences that I have retained since high school. These include my extra
curiculars, my athletics, and most importantly, my acedemics. Among these qualities,
 I believe that my sports extracurriculars stand out the most, since I have been
involved for a very long time.</p>
