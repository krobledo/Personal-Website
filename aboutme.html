					<h1>High School</h1>
					<p> During my years in high school, I attended the Baccalaureate School for Global Education, where I received an IB education. The school itself was small and was very defined in it's structure. It is there where I earned an IB Diploma and an international
						education. </p>

					<h1>Community Service and Action</h1>
					<p> Woodside On The Move Volunteer: (Summer 2014) I volunteered at an elementary school for the non-profit organization, Woodside on the Move. Their mission is to provide children with a summer camp that not only promoted education but also the enjoyment
						of outside activities. I assisted children with special needs in the younger grades by helping them with classwork.
						<br>
						<br> Varsity Soccer Team: (Fall 2014, 2015) For most of the fall semester, I was a starter of my schoolâ€™s varsity soccer team, BSGE F.C.; we played against other PSAL developmental teams. I held a strong position as a midfielder and a starter at
						left back.
						<br>
						<br> Socrates Sculpture Park: (Summer 2015) Throughout the summer, I assisted Socrates Sculpture Park by volunteering as a teacher to help other children create different art pieces.
						<br>
						<br> Math Club: (2015-Present) As a member of the BSGE Math Club, I participated in finding the solutions for difficult problems, as well as helping and receiving help for the SAT II Math preparatory classes.

					<h1>Hacking Sessions</h1>
					<p> During the end of the year and entering into the next, I spent my Saturday mornings learning about programming and the fundamentals of Computer Science. I learned about the basics of programming, as well as contributed to the creation of some web
